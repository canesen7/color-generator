**Hi.**

This project is about generate and edit color palettes that I created using React. 

I used React Hooks in this project.

You can generate a color picker and lock you liked.

##### If you want to see a magic, press "SPACE" button.

You can change all the seven colours.

If you like a color, you can copy that when you click color code.
